# Toby Fox Heardle (Undertale, Deltarune, and more!)

# Still very WIP, absolutely not ready to play yet. If you want to help, don't hesitate to get in contact, or just submit code!

**DISCLAIMER: If you want to play this legitimately, don't look in main.js or extension.js or you'll be spoiled on what songs will be used in the future.**

Toby Fox Heardle is a game that tests your knowledge of his wide range of work. Whether you're mostly familiar with his standalone games, or his Homestuck contributions, I'm sure you'll have plenty of fun with this game

Toby Fox Heardle was started on [insert the date i eventually go live with this], and was forked from [Mario Heardle](https://github.com/NinjiGalaxy/mario-heardle), which can be traced back to WJSN Heardle, available here: https://github.com/jeroldcamacho/wjsn-heardle which was of course, a clone of the original Heardle which sadly was shut down by Spotify only 9 months after they bought it. I hope you enjoy it!
